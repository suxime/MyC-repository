# ToSic.Sxc.Hybrid for DNN

This folder should contain the DNN implementations of the hybrid stuff. 

## Notes / Best Practices

* We'll create subfolders for managing the code
* but all the objects for the custom work should be in the `ToSic.Sxc.Hybrid` namespace  
  don't use sub-namespaces because it just makes the docs harder to read / organize.
